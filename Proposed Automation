ðŸ“˜ Manpower Platform â€“ Automation Strategy (n8n Integration Guide)

Overview

This document outlines the necessary automation workflows to be implemented via n8n, even alongside a full-stack, production-grade platform. These workflows streamline operational efficiency, reduce manual workload, and accelerate go-to-market readiness.

n8n complements the backend by managing external integrations, asynchronous logic, and business workflows that would otherwise bloat core app code.

ðŸš€ Why Use n8n?

While the full-stack Manpower platform (built with Next.js 14, Node.js, PostgreSQL, etc.) will handle core application logic (e.g., user authentication, dashboards, matchmaking), n8n is still essential for:
	â€¢	External API Integrations (Email, WhatsApp, Truecaller, Calendly)
	â€¢	Automated Business Processes (Certification reminders, feedback loops)
	â€¢	Scheduled Jobs (Daily/weekly reports, alerts)
	â€¢	Faster Iteration & Workflow Testing (Low-code, dynamic, and non-blocking)

âœ… Automation Workflow Summary

Each scenario below is categorized based on where it lives architecturally:

#	Scenario	Description	Ownership	Reason
1	Guard Application Automation	Validates documents, fraud checks, reminders, and onboarding communication	n8n	Involves 3rd-party APIs and time-based logic
2	Client Onboarding Sequence	Welcome email, CRM sync, portfolio delivery, intro call setup	n8n	External systems, marketing ops
3	Guard Certification Workflow	Sends reminders, grades quizzes, issues certificates	Hybrid	Backend tracks course, n8n handles notifications and scoring
4	AI Job Matching Notifications	Delivers matching job alerts to guards	Hybrid	Matching in backend; delivery via n8n
5	Client Feedback Loop	Follow-up after placements, feedback forms, alerts on low scores	n8n	Repetitive, time-triggered, rating-based
6	Marketing & Referrals	Posts to socials, sends campaigns, tracks referral conversions	n8n	Entirely external marketing stack
7	Monthly Quality Reporting	Aggregates KPIs and sends internal performance reports	n8n	Cron-based jobs, analytics exports
8	Guard Offboarding / Blacklisting	Flags, alerts, disables accounts, logs violations	Hybrid	Policy trigger in backend, action via n8n


ðŸ”§ Recommended n8n Nodes & Integrations
	â€¢	HTTP Request â€“ for fraud check, AI APIs (OpenAI, OCR, etc.)
	â€¢	Twilio / WhatsApp Cloud API â€“ for messaging guards & clients
	â€¢	Gmail / SendGrid â€“ for transactional and onboarding emails
	â€¢	Google Sheets / Airtable â€“ as lightweight internal CRMs or trackers
	â€¢	PDF Generator (e.g., PDFMonkey) â€“ for certificate generation
	â€¢	Slack / Telegram â€“ for internal alerts
	â€¢	Cron Trigger â€“ for scheduling jobs like monthly reports
	â€¢	OpenAI / Ollama â€“ for scoring answers or content generation

ðŸ§± Best Practices
	â€¢	Use environment-based workflows (dev/test/prod) in n8n
	â€¢	Store webhook secrets and API keys in n8n environment variables
	â€¢	Use retry + alert logic for critical automations (like certifications)
	â€¢	Maintain a visual n8n dashboard for workflow health monitoring
	â€¢	Use Sub-Workflows in n8n to reduce duplication (e.g., Email Notification Flow)

ðŸ›  Deployment Notes
	â€¢	Deploy n8n on Docker or n8n.cloud
	â€¢	Connect n8n to your core PostgreSQL/Supabase DB for seamless integration
	â€¢	Secure Webhook endpoints with basic auth or IP whitelisting
	â€¢	Use queue mode and Redis for high-scale automation reliability
